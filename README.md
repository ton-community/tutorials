## The Tutorial System

### Design goals

- A concise list of tutorials that help new TON developers onboard
- Allow multiple community contributors to help maintain the tutorials
- Support multiple development flavors, tools and styles side by side
- Know when tutorials break (for example due to library changes) and need fixing

### Build the tutorials

- Create the file `.env` in the project root with this content:

  ```bash
  MNEMONIC="unfold sugar water ..."
  ```

  > The official mnemonic appears in Github repo secrets since it's also used in CI. This should be the 24 word mnemonic for a deployed testnet v4 wallet that contains at least 1 TON.
- Run `./build.sh`
- Resulting files will be created in the `docs/` directory, ready for Github Pages

### Notice

> Due to limitations in GitHub Actions, we are unable to use secrets to store a secure mnemonic for the wallet during the testing of pull requests from forked repositories by our contributors. 
> As a result, we are currently using a public wallet with an exposed mnemonic in our test files when running tests in GH Actions.
